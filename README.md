  # Succor-Smart-Glove
My device, The Succor Smart Glove, is a device that can be used by disabled or elderly patients to interact with others by sending signals through the wearable glove. The objective of this research is to assist the patient in providing an emergency command to the nurse or doctor regarding the patientâ€™s needs. In addition, the patient can control tasks in their room by moving their fingers. This device consists of a glove with flex sensors and an electrical conditional circuit. The flex sensors bend with the patient's finger to determine the position of their finger. This paper is on the exploration and implementation of a finger position measurement system for one hand.
To determine the overall benefit of the Smart Glove, an experiment was designed to compare the effectiveness of the glove to work without it. The investigation began by testing the time it took to activate a fan, turn on a light, and send a message after receiving the signal from the glove, then comparing it to the time it took to complete those tasks without the glove. From the data gathered, the Smart Glove actuated the fan and light bulb while sending text messages within 2 seconds. Without the glove, the average time to complete these tasks was about 2 minutes, a 6,000% increase.
